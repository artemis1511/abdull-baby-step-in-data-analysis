## project objective:Exploring global Covid-19 Data to gain insights

...

### Data Sourcing
Data used was scraped from  https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series
...

### Data Transformation
Data loaded in from Web into Power Query on Excel. Some data cleaning ensued making first row as headers,removing unwanted columns ,formatting the date column as date and then creating new columns month,year from it.
Changes saved and data loaded back to Excel . I then made pivot tables and pivot charts to illustrate key insights such as Countries with most reported cases of COVID-19,Countries with least reported cases etc.


...

### Findings and Recommendations
All of these pivot charts then aggregated into a single interactive dashboard with which findings can be presented.
